### Week #1:
- We have a lot of solid science to support the habits and behaviors that we will learn in this course.
- Knowing is NOT half the battle.
- Surveys to establish the current level of happiness and strengths

#### Week 1 Rewirements: Measure Your Happiness and Discover Your Strengths
- Examples of exercises for each strength [https://www.viacharacter.org/topics/articles/tips-for-using-each-character-strength-in-a-new-way]

### Week #2: Misconceptions about happiness
- Myths:
    * What do you think will make you happy? In the next month or so, in an year or so, in 5 years
    * Good job/compensation: The amount of money we think we need grows more as we earn more and more.
    * Awesome stuff doesn't make us happy. In fact, seeking it make us unhappier. Those who reported materialist attitudes have lower life satisfaction than those who reported non-materialist attitudes.
    * True love - Married people are happier in the first 1-2 years and then it is same as unmarried people. And if you are in a unhappy marriage, it is worse.
    * Having perfect face/body, etc. - Also not.
- Actually genes or circumstances don't make much of a difference as we think - 50% genes, 10% circumstances, 40% attitude


### Week #3: 
Our minds trick us:
- We are often wrong about what and how happy some things will make us.
Miswanting: The act of being mistaken about what and how much you will like something in the future.
- We don't think in absolutes but in comparison to a reference point. Our mind soaks in whatever reference points it gets and doesn't actively choose it. We should be mindful of and filter what we expose our mind to. According to a study, job satisfaction decreases when comparative income (income of people we use as the reference point) increases. Another example is Bronze medal winners looking happier than Silver medal winners since their reference point is almost missing the medal as compared to Silver medal winners, the reference for whom is not winning the Gold medal. Another study asked participants to choose between two options: You earning 50K and all others in your firm earning 25K; or you earning 100K and all others in the firm earning 250K. The majority of the people choose the first option
- Hedonic Adaptation - Our mind gets used to stuff - both good and bad.
- Impact Bias - We tend to overestimate the emotional impact of a future event both in terms of intensity and its duration. We don't seem to get better at predicting our own reaction to things with more experience.
- Why are we so bad at predicting how we will feel? Why don't we learn how resilient we are? Focalism - The tendency to think about just one event and forget about the other things that happen; and Immune Neglect - Unawareness of our "psychological immune system", i.e., our tendency to adapt to and cope with negative events.

### Week #3: EFFORTFUL and INTENTIONAL Strategies
- Spend on experiences over material things, they are by definition temporary and the mind can't get used to it. Thinking about a future planned experience is also more pleasant and filled with excitement than a planned future purchase. Talking about experiences makes us more likeable than if we were to talk about things we bought/own.
- How to thwarth Hedonic Adaptation
    - Savor your experience while you're having it.
        - Activities that enhance savoring:
            * I talked to another person about how good I felt
            * I looked for other people to share it with
            * I thought about what a lucky person I am
            * I thought about sharing this later with others
            * I showed physical expressions of energy
            * I laughed or giggled
            * I told myself how proud I was
            * I thought only about the present, was absorbed
        - Activities that hurt savoring:
            * I focused on the future, when it was over.
            * I reminded myself it would be over soon.
            * I told myself it wasn't as good as I hoped
            * I reminded myself that nothing lasts forever
            * I thought how it would never be this good again
            * I thought about ways it could be better
            * I told myself I didn't deserve this good thing
    - Rewinding and replaying happy memories regularly/daily
    - Negative Visualization - Imagine how it would have been had you not been/gotten X/Y/Z and explicitly write about it.
    - Make the day the last day - Imagine this is the last day in your life with X/Y/Z
    - Gratitude - The quality of being thankful and a tendency to show appreciation for what one has. If you are thinking about what you are grateful for you, you won’t have as much mental bandwidth to make harmful social comparisons.  
- How to reset our reference points:
    * Concretely re-experience: how it was before and live how it was?
    * Concretely observe: Observe what I have been fantasizing about really.
    * Avoid social comparisons:
        * Curate your reference points: Exposing yourself to more accurate reference points (e.g. models that are more representative of the average person’s body) and avoiding reference points that allow for upward social comparisons (e.g. supermodels) can help prevent the most harmful and inaccurate social comparisons.
        * Stop Technique: If you notice yourself making social comparisons, saying “stop” out loud can help you halt that train of thought and switch over to thinking about other things.
        * Quit Social Media
    * Interrupt your consumption: Don't dive in to the stuff you enjoy in one go, but take one piece at a time -> add interruptions in between. For example, people tend to be enjoying their favorite shows more when there are advertisements in between. For bad things, squish them all together for hedonic adaption.
    * Variety is the spice of life: Doing things a little more variably will change our reference points

### Week #4: What really makes us happy
- "Miswanting" - We want the wrong things. Are there things that we should be wanting that we don't usually realise?
    - Better Wanting #1: Wanting the right parts of the things we already want
        - What factors should we seek in a job?
            - Roles that leverage or capitalize on one's signature strengths - signature strengths are one's own character strengths that we value about our personality and tend to make us feel authentic and engaged. There is a standard classification of 24 Character Strengths by some researchers and the survey in the beginning helps us identify our current character strengths. When we employ our character strengths in different ways at work, our job/career seem to feel more fulfilling, more like a calling than work.
            - Roles that tend to increasae "flow". Flow is a mental state where one is fully involved, focused, energized and immersed in an activity. Features of flow include:
                - Challenging yet attainable goal
                - Strong focus concentration
                - The activity is intrinsically rewarding
                - Loss of self-consciousness and feelings of serenity
                - Loss of the sense of time
                - Complete focus on the activity itself.
            The state of flow tend to be reaches when we feel both challenged and get to apply well-developed skills in a meaningful way. They find in some research that people tend to prefer leisure time over work, yet during leisure time, they have often feelings of apathy and boredom, rather than self-confidence/efficacy, pointing to a clear disconnect. It might be worthwhile to rethink the leisure activities we engage in and perhaps choose something a bit more challenging or something that develops a skill we enjoy.
