#### Introduction
Very quickly, I was onboard with the message here. I also thought about this busyness in our lives. Trying to be productive means we take in more and more, and it is a never-ending list. As in, we want to become robots trying to treat life as a optimising problem than to soak it in and "live".

#### Chapter 1: The Limit-Embracing Life
I really realted too well with the words here on multiple counts:
- He talks about how the idea of "using" time is deeply entrenched in the current societal fabric, which seemed to not only make sense but also in a way, reassuring given I feel very inadquate at work, and struggle a lot with procrastination. It deeply affects my self-worth, and lately I have been trying to try a lot of productivity tricks like Pomodromo technique only to feel disappointed in myself and my self-descipline etiquette. 
- Some of the themes about accepting the painful limitations of life and our humanity spoke to me on a spiritual level around the concept of simply acceptance and self-compassion.
- I don't quite "grasped" the premise of sense of time being different back when the concept of clocks was non-existent. It seemed like a superficial and pseudo-romanticized idea around how in this "deep time" trance/state, there is less sense of urgency or rush or "making every moment count", but quite an interesting idea. Maybe I am one of these proverbial fishes which doesn't understand the concept of air.
- I also sensed some rebuke for capitalism, which I vehemently agree to, but I also feel this has become one of these woke ideas that all popular authors seem to mention. I am a critic myself, and I have some tendency towards anarchism, but I hope we can hopefully bring the best of two worlds together. Well, that's another topic though.
- When it comes to quoting German philosophers, personally I would be happier to read to some Schaupenhauer over Nietzsche. But well, the author can't please everyone, no!?
- The lines I loved:
    - > We recoil from the notion that this is it - that *this* life, with all its flaws and inescapable vulnerabilities, its extreme brevity, and our limited influence over how it unfolds, is the only one we'll get a shot at.
    - > We don't have to consciously participate in what it's like to feel claustrophobic, imprisoned, powerless, and constrained by reality
    - > Haste is universal because everyone is in flight from himself.

#### Chapter 2
The author goes on for many pages about the same theme that the idea of getting and more done just gets more stuff to do. This is true for all levels, and had been a theme for humanity for quite some decades/centuries.
- What I found interesting is that there was an idea that when people believed in an afterlife, the pressure to make the best out of *this* life is essentially absent. True, we atheists/agnostics seculars, we can't really count on the glorious afterlife.
- We should instead strive for learning to stay with the anxiety of feeling overwhelmed.
