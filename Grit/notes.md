## Part 1: What Grit is and why it matters?
#### Chapter 1: Showing up
- Grit is mutable
- Grit is more important than talent
- Grit is essentially perseverance towards goal(s) one is passionate about
- With the [Grit scale](https://angeladuckworth.com/grit-scale/) that the author developed seems to be the strongest predictor of success in comparison to any other attempt so far.

#### Chapter 2: Distracted by talent
- We hear often since childhood about being a "natural" in certain areas, but neither in her own experience nor in research is talent a "reliable" predictor of accomplishment in the same areas one presumably "gifted" in. What really often is consistent and prolonged effort.
- Even though most people surveyed valued hard-working qualities more than intelligence; in an experiment, they show a bias for talent. Inadvertently we seem to value talent more than we like to believe/admit, even to ourselves.

#### Chapter 3: Effort counts twice
- There are a lot of things that contribute to achievement like dumb luck, or mentors, etc. If we were to look at the psychology of accomplishment, the author summarizes it in two equations:
    - Talent * Effort = Skill, and
    - Skill * Effort = Achievement.
- Even though, talent can be very important, but effort counts more, in fact, as much as twice according to the author.
- The distinction between talent and skill is often missed, according to the author. Talent is simply unfulfilled potential, and only with effort, it CAN become a skill. She argues that someone twice as talented but who puts half as much effort can't simply achieve as much (all else being same).
- Following through on your goals, keeping at it, putting effort even on bad days is an integral part of grit.

#### Chapter 4: How gritty are you?
- Here she offers the questionnaire that she has extensively used for measuring Grit.
- Grit is more about stamina than it is about consistency over time.
- Grit = Passion + Perseverence
- Another interesting idea was the heirarchy of goals that one pursues - we can have "smaller" goals like acing a test, improving our understanding of a topic, with an overarching goal of becoming knowledgeable in a field, with an overarching goal of making the world a better place, etc. We can also cluster these goals to arrive at the top-level goals. And it is important to have the vision of the end goals(s), which should be 1-2 - maybe one related to career and another related to personal life.
- Goal conflict is imminent but such a structure helps weigh in the choices and opportunity costs. This also helps us decide which goals are not worth pursuing, even though we still pursue the corresponding mid-level or top-level goals.

### Chapter 5: Grit grows
- Is grit heritable? She says possibly, there is no single gene that explains it and it could be like most qualities which are explained by hundreds and thousands of genes. On top of that, the influence of nurture trumps the influence of nature with examples of height and IQ, both of which have increased significantly in the population within a short period.
- Among different age groups, Grit also seems to increase with age. This is of course, a snapshot of time and it could be that some generational changes influenced the lower scores for younger adults, but it could also be that as we gain more life experience, we also develop resilience, allowing us to tackle any obstacles that come our way. We learn to rise to occasion when confronted by challenges.
- If you'd like to be more gritty, find out where you are on the Grit scale and ask yourself why? The grittiest folks have:
    - (intrinsic) interest
    - practice - always trying to improve even when one could be labelled as an expert
    - purpose - interest without purpose is almost impossible to sustain
    - hope

## Part 2: Growing Grit from the inside out
### Chapter 6: Interest
- Most people feel more fulfilled and try harder at work when they enjoy it.
- Most young people don't have a passion to pursue in the first place, so they should try to foster a passion.
- Passion for your work is a little bit of discovery, followed by a lot of development, and then a lifetime of deepening.
- Interests are not discovered by introspection, but by exposure and see what sticks.
- Before hard work comes play, we can't force an interest. A degree of autonomy during the early years is also important. Shortcutting this playful interest, discovery and development can have dire consequences.
- Some questions to guide the process of learning about your interests:
    - What do I like to think about?
    - Where does my mind wander?
    - What do I really care about?
    - What matters the most to me?
    - How do I enjoy spending my time?
    - And, in contrast, what do I find absolutely unbearable?
- Experiment, experiment, experiment to see what sticks!

### Chapter 7: Practice
- Not just about more time on task, but also better time at task, i.e., not just repeating something, but repeating it while trying to improve and/or with a goal. This means the practice may be more effortful and less enjoyable.
- Gritty people not just have more effortful practice but also more flow states which are spontaneous highly enjoyable seemingly effortless states, where they feel challenged to the edge of their abilities and are also applying their already acquired skills.
- Flow is an experience VS "Effortful/Deliberate" Practice is a behavior.
- Requirements of deliberate practice and then make it a habit:
    - A clearly defined stretch goal
    - Full concentration and effort
    - Immediate and informative feedback
    - Repetition with reflection and refinement

### Chapter 8: Purpose
- Create a list of your goals and cluster them together to find high-level as well low-level goals.

### Chapter 9: Growth Mindset/Hope
- Growth Mindset -> Optimistic Self-talk -> Perseverance in the face of adversity

## Part 3: Growing Grit from the outside in
### Chapter 10: Parenting for Grit
- Kids need love as well as limits, they are not always the best judge of what they want or what is good for them.

### Chapter 11: The playing fields of grit or inculcating grit
- Extra-curricular activities
- You can quit, but you can't quit on a bad day.

### Chapter 12: A culture of Grit
- Example of J. P. Morgan Chase
