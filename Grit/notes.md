## Part 1: What Grit is and why it matters?
#### Chapter 1: Showing up
- Grit is mutable
- Grit is more important than talent
- Grit is essentially perseverance towards goal(s) one is passionate about
- With the [Grit scale](https://angeladuckworth.com/grit-scale/) that the author developed seems to be the strongest predictor of success in comparison to any other attempt so far.

#### Chapter 2: Distracted by talent
- We hear often since childhood about being a "natural" in certain areas, but neither in her own experience nor in research is talent a "reliable" predictor of accomplishment in the same areas one presumably "gifted" in. What really often is consistent and prolonged effort.
- Even though most people surveyed valued hard-working qualities more than intelligence; in an experiment, they show a bias for talent. Inadvertently we seem to value talent more than we like to believe/admit, even to ourselves.

#### Chapter 3: Effort counts twice
- There are a lot of things that contribute to achievement like dumb luck, or mentors, etc. If we were to look at the psychology of accomplishment, the author summarizes it in two equations:
    - Talent * Effort = Skill, and
    - Skill * Effort = Achievement.
- Even though, talent can be very important, but effort counts more, in fact, as much as twice according to the author.
- The distinction between talent and skill is often missed, according to the author. Talent is simply unfulfilled potential, and only with effort, it CAN become a skill. She argues that someone twice as talented but who puts half as much effort can't simply achieve as much (all else being same).
- Following through on your goals, keeping at it, putting effort even on bad days is an integral part of grit.

#### Chapter 4: How gritty are you?
- Here she offers the questionnaire that she has extensively used for measuring Grit.
- Grit is more about stamina than it is about consistency over time.
- Grit = Passion + Perseverence
- Another interesting idea was the heirarchy of goals that one pursues - we can have "smaller" goals like acing a test, improving our understanding of a topic, with an overarching goal of becoming knowledgeable in a field, with an overarching goal of making the world a better place, etc. We can also cluster these goals to arrive at the top-level goals. And it is important to have the vision of the end goals(s), which should be 1-2 - maybe one related to career and another related to personal life.
- Goal conflict is imminent but such a structure helps weigh in the choices and opportunity costs. This also helps us decide which goals are not worth pursuing, even though we still pursue the corresponding mid-level or top-level goals.
