### Week #1:
- You will spend many years throughout your life working, and you're likely to feel that your years spent working will be better spent if you believe that the work you do matters to someone, somewhere, somehow. Researchers have found that when we believe we are engaged in meaningful work, we have greater pride in what we do. Feel more responsibility for the outcomes of our work. Are more willing to above and beyond the call of duty.
- A sustainable career fits with your values, provides enough financial security to take care of your economic needs, and is flexible enough to evolve as your interests and life stages change. If you want a sustainable career, you'll need to actively manage your career in order to stay employable as well as employed. You'll need to take steps to ensure your expertise stays relevant. Which means understanding how the environment is changing and investing in lifelong learning. You'll want to make sure you're getting measurable results in whatever jobs you have, so that no one will ever doubt your ability to add value wherever you are. You'll want to be sure you have a diverse network of mutually supportive relationships, as well as a reputation for being a team player, and for being the kind of person people want to work with. So that many people will support you in whatever career you choose. And you'll want to keep money in the bank as a cushion for the expected and unexpected changes that may come your way.
- External measures of success are things that are objective and can be seen and evaluated by others as well as yourself. Things such as status and titles, degrees, awards, what you get paid, where you live, and what you drive.  Judging your career primarily on external measures can be hard on your self-esteem if you lose your status, title, salary or other external indicators, if that's how you measure your worth. Internal measures of success include things that are subjective, which means only you can decide whether or not they matter to you. These are things like believing you're making a difference through your work, feeling as though your work is aligned with your values, taking pride in the day-to-day work that you do.
- You are more likely to achieve your goals if you believe your personality and intelligence are fluid. You can increase your analytical intelligence - as well as many other skills that are central to your success through devoted practice. Over-relying on analytical intelligence can prevent you from learning other talents that are equally - and sometimes more - important to your success and well-being in life.

### Week #2: Growth Mindset and the power of beliefs
#### Growth Mindset
- For people with a fixed mindset, focusing primarily on their strengths may serve them well for a while as they continue to excel in what they already do well. But as they continue to miss out on opportunities to take risks, learn, and grow, their strategy of focusing on their strengths can backfire in the long run because their strengths that helped them in the path may not help them in the future especially if the environment changes and they don't change with it. In contrast, people who have a growth mindset believe more in nurture than in nature. They believe that intelligent, talents, and personality characteristics are learned and can change over time with effort and practice. They are more likely to say, she worked hard to get where she is today. I can become a great speaker if I put my mind to it. And leaders are made, not born. They believe that effort, careful planning, and ongoing learning, more so than natural ability, predict people's ability to achieve success, and they make their day-to-day choices and pursue their goals according to this belief. 
- They are more likely to see mistakes as opportunities for learning rather than as signs of permanent personal flaws. They are more likely to seek out negative feedback and persist when faced with hurdles and setbacks. Because they believe these are to be expected as they move step by step toward their goals. In fact many people with a growth mindset find negative feedback, hurdles, and setbacks to be motivating rather than demoralizing, and they double up their efforts to improve their performance.

#### Positive Core Self-Evaluations
People tend to have general and fundamental assumptions about themselves in the following four areas:
- Self Esteem: Do I feel good about myself in general?
- Self Efficacy: Do I think I can achieve what I set out to do?
- Locus of Control: Do I believe I largely determine what will happen in my life?
- Emotional Stability: Do I cope well with ups and downs of everyday life?

People with high core self-evaluations are likely to have more confidence in their abilities, feel like they have control over their lives, and tend to see the world in an optimistic way. They tend to also capitalize on opportunities.

### Week #3: The power of expertise
- 

### Week #4: The power of self-motivation
#### Conscientiousness
- feeling a sense of responsibility
- example of a 9 year old kid who was the school monitor and went back during an earthquake to save his classmates
- shouldn't be overdone - example of people being unhappy after being unemployed because their sense of self is highly associated with work
- works better when we are also cooperative

#### Grit
- Grit is defined as passion and perseverance toward a long-term goal. Gritty people apply their focus to a single long-term goal that's extremely meaningful to them. Rejection and being told they can't do something fuels their determination. Grit is like conscientiousness on steroids. Grit is like living life as a marathon not as a sprint. And she is convinced that grit can be learned.
- First, list up to 25 goals. Second, circle the five that are the highest priority. Those that are most aligned with what's most important to you in life. Third, look at the goals that you did in circle and don't pay much time and energy toward those goals. Because they'll distract you from your top goals. Buffett says it more starkly, avoid the goals on the second list at all costs. Deciding what you're not going to do is as important as deciding what you will do. And then, you ask yourself to what extent do my top five goals serve a common purpose? By aligning your goals, the effort you put into one of your top goals is likely to benefit your other goals as well.
- Overly gritty carry some risks Sometimes it's healthier to quit, particularly when the goal is unachievable or if the situation has changed to one in which the goal is no longer worth the effort required.

### Week #5: The power of relationships
#### Social Capital
- Mutually supportive relationships that are build on authencity, good will, respect, and reciprocity
- Can you think about 12 people to approach for answering a 20 minutes questionnairre about your working style, strengths and weaknesses?
##### Common Myths:
- Myth #1: It's not what you know, it's who you know
- Myth #2: Proactive networking is manipulative
- Myth #3: Extroverts have better networks than introverts
- Myth #4: I'm so busy, I don't have time for building relationships

##### Are you an Energizer?
- Walk the talk
- Realistic optimists
- Intellectually stimulate all around them with a compelling vision
- They inspire/increase psychological resourcefulness
- Energy as emotional contagion

##### Your Social Capital
- Build your sociogram with post-its, people you interacted with in the past 6 months, grouping them together in groups and then connecting those who know each other
- Assess your network for size, diversity, structure (redundancy - are you the clique?) and strength (mutually invested in each other's success)
- We need both career mentors as well as sponsors
- Successful people don't leave their network to chance but actively build a network of mutually supportive relationships
