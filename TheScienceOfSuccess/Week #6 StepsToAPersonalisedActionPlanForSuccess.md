### Step 1: Identify at least Three Areas of Your Life that are Most Important to You
Identify at least three parts of your life that are most important to you (for example, your family, your career, your job) and provide an explanation of why each of these parts is of great importance to you.

### Step 2:  List at least 3 Goals You Want to Achieve in Each of These Life Areas 
For each of the parts of your life that you identified in Step 1 as being most important, list atleast three goals that you would like to achieve. For example, the “work” category may include goals such as becoming an engaging communicator, getting better results at work, and becoming a better negotiator. The “career” category may include goals such as getting promotions, earning salary increases, enjoying your job, having job flexibility, working part-time at some point, and retiring at a specific age. And the “well-being” category may include goals such as becoming or staying healthy, being happy, growing spiritually or psychologically, having financial security, spending time with your friends and family, participating in your religious or other communities, and spending time doing things you care about.

### Step 3: Identify the Goal You Want to Start Working on Immediately
Of all the goals you listed in Step 2, choose only one goal that you want to begin working on immediately (for example, become an engaging communicator).  Explain why you chose this particular goal to invest in immediately and provide a description of what you expect to gain from achieving this goal.

### Step 4: Create Your Action Plan
Create an action plan by documenting at least three specific actions you will take to achieve the goal you identified in Step 3. Include the following components in your action plan: (1) what you will do; (2) when you will do it; (3) who you will tell about your plan, and (4) how you will measure success.

### Step 5: Identify What You Will Stop Doing
Identify at least one behavior that you will modify or that you will stop doing so that you can focus more of your time and effort on the goal you identified in Step 4 (for example, I will limit the time I spend on social media to 15 minutes a day).

### Step 6: Identify the Two Most Important Lessons You Learned
Describe the two most important lessons that you learned from creating your Personalized Action Plan and/or by taking the Science of Success course.
